 * Editing guide:
 * - Feel free to rewrite the sentences and bullet lists.
 * - Leave anything wrapped in double curly braces (e.g., {{subject}}) exactly
 *   as-is â€“ those placeholders are filled in automatically when the prompts run.
 * - JSON shapes should remain valid (e.g., keep braces/brackets and field names).

- Assignment due dates, test dates, project deadlines
- School events: meetings, sports, performances, field trips

Sent: {{sentDate}}
Full Body: {{body}}

Instructions:
- Focus on real-world dates for assignments, events, meetings, practices, trips, reminders.
- Convert relative references ("next Thursday") into absolute YYYY-MM-DD using the sent date.
- Only include events after the sent date.
- Use rich, specific titles and descriptions.
- IMPORTANT: Always extract lunch/cafeteria menus. When you see a section like "CAFETERIA" or "WHAT'S FOR LUNCH" with day-of-week entries (Monday: Chicken, Tuesday: Pizza, etc.), convert each day to the actual date of that weekday in the upcoming week. For example, if the email was sent on Saturday Sept 28, then "Monday: Chicken" becomes "2025-09-30" (the following Monday). Create one event per day with title "Lunch: [menu item]".

Respond with JSON array:
[
  {
    "title": "specific event title",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "time": "HH:MM" (24h, optional),
    "description": "context + requirements",
